With the addition of data augmentation and dropout in Exercise 2, we were able to increase accuracy to about 80%. That seems decent, but 20% is still too high of an error rate. Maybe we just don't have enough training data available to properly solve the problem. What other approaches can we try?\n","\n","In this exercise, we'll look at two techniques for repurposing feature data generated from image models that have already been trained on large sets of data, **feature extraction** and **fine tuning**, and use them to improve the accuracy of our cat vs. dog classification model."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"dI5rmt4UBwXs"},"source":["## Feature Extraction Using a Pretrained Model\n","\n","One thing that is commonly done in computer vision is to take a model trained on a very large dataset, run it on your own, smaller dataset, and extract the intermediate representations (features) that the model generates. These representations are frequently informative for your own computer vision task, even though the task may be quite different from the problem that the original model was trained on. This versatility and repurposability of convnets is one of the most interesting aspects of deep learning.\n","\n","In our case, we will use the [Inception V3 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) developed at Google, and pre-trained on [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/), a large dataset of web images (1.4M images and 1000 classes). This is a powerful model; let's see what the features that it has learned can do for our cat vs. dog problem.\n","\n","First, we need to pick which intermediate layer of Inception V3 we will use for feature extraction. A common practice is to use the output of the very last layer before the `Flatten` operation, the so-called \"bottleneck layer.\" The reasoning here is that the following fully connected layers will be too specialized for the task the network was trained on, and thus the features learned by these layers won't be very useful for a new task.

The first few layers in a convnet learn very simple and generic features, which generalize to almost all types of images.
