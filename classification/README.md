SupportClassification_FineTuning_10Supports_Callbacks.ipynb: most recent notebook, training for 16 hrs to create p1, p2, p3 weights in ten_class weights
SupportClassification_FineTuning_10Supports.ipynb: stuff shown in powerpoint except last one which is from the Callbacks version
Saliency_and_visualization_10Supports_tfdotkeras.ipynb: work in progress for saliency maps
SupportClassiication_fineTuning_10Supports_notclassbalancedloss: no class balanced loss, baseline model shown in powerpoint
